Admin Panel makes it easy to setup and maintain admin features for your Vapor project. Here's a list of some of the top feautures that comes out of the box with this package:

- **UI Components:** Admin Panel is built using [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/), a highly battle-tested and maintained Control Panel Template. This means that you'll have access to features from AdminLTE through [Leaf](https://docs.vapor.codes/2.0/leaf/leaf/#leaf) tags.
- **User System:** This package come with a (admin panel) user system with roles built-in. The package also handles welcome emails and reset-password flows.
- **SSO Support:** Built-in support for adding your own custom SSO provider.
- **Activities**: Need to broadcast certain updates to the admin panel users? No problem, Admin Panel gives you some convenient functionality to manage an activity log.

## üì¶ Installation

### Install package using SPM

Update your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/nodes-vapor/admin-panel-provider.git", majorVersion: 0, minorVersion: 1)
```

Next time you run e.g. `vapor update` Admin Panel will be installed.

### Install resources

Move the `Resources`and `Public` folders from this repo into your project. Unfortunately there's no convenient to this at the moment, but one option is to download this repo as a zip and then move the folders into the root of your project. Remember to check that you're not overwriting any files in your project.


## üöÄ Getting started

### Add provider

In your `Config+Setup.swift` (or wherever you setup your providers), make sure to add the Admin Panel provider:

```swift
import AdminPanelProvider

// ...

private func setupProviders() throws {
    // ...
    try addProvider(AdminPanelProvider.Provider.self)
}
```

### Setup view renderer

This package relies heavily on the [Leaf](https://docs.vapor.codes/2.0/leaf/package/) view renderer. For Admin Panel to work, please make sure that you have added the `LeafProvider`:

```swift
import LeafProvider

// ...

private func setupProviders() throws {
    // ...
    try addProvider(LeafProvider.Provider.self)
}
```

After adding the provider, please make sure that your project is using Leaf as the view renderer. To do that, please ensure that the `view` key is set correctly in `droplet.json`:

```json
"//": "Choose which view renderer to use",
"//": "leaf: Vapor's Leaf renderer",
"view": "leaf"
```

### Seed a user

If you haven't added a SSO provider, the next thing you need to do is to seed a user in order to be able to login into your new admin panel. To do this, first add the seeder command to your `commands` array in your `droplet.json`:

```json
"//": "Choose which commands this application can run",
"//": "prepare: Supplied by the Fluent provider. Prepares the database (configure in fluent.json)",
"commands": [
    "prepare",
    "admin-panel:seeder"
],
```

Next run the seeder by doing:

```
vapor build; vapor run admin-panel:seeder
```

The user that will be created using the seeder will have the following credentials:

- Email: **admin@admin.com**
- Password: **admin**

### Vapor & Fuzzy Array
Vapor has a `Node.fuzzy` array that's used for dynamically casting at runtime. If you're experiencing inconsistencies with rendering templates it's most likely because your fuzzy array is missing `ViewData.self` Ensure that you have added it to the array or that all of your models conform to `JSON`/`Node`.
Example `Node.fuzzy`:
```swift
extension Config {
    public func setup() throws {
        // allow fuzzy conversions for these types
        // (add your own types here)
        Node.fuzzy = [JSON.self, Node.self, ViewData.self]
```

### Custom Leaf tags
Admin Panel comes with a bunch of custom Leaf tags that help ease the burden of frontend development. Check out the full list [here](https://github.com/nodes-vapor/admin-panel-provider/wiki/Leaf-Tags).

### CORS:
It's highly recommended that you add the [CORS middleware](https://docs.vapor.codes/2.0/http/cors/) to your project.

## üîß Configurations

Admin Panel can be configured by (adding or) modifying the `adminpanel.json` config file. Below is a breakdown of the available keys.
