Admin Panel makes it easy to setup and maintain admin features for your Vapor project. Here's a list of some of the top feautures that comes out of the box with this package:

- **UI Components:** Admin Panel is built using [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/), a highly battle-tested and maintained Control Panel Template. This means that you'll have access to features from AdminLTE through [Leaf](https://docs.vapor.codes/2.0/leaf/leaf/#leaf) tags.
- **User System:** This package come with a (admin panel) user system with roles built-in. The package also handles welcome emails and reset-password flows.
- **SSO Support:** Built-in support for adding your own custom SSO provider.
- **Activities**: Need to broadcast certain updates to the admin panel users? No problem, Admin Panel gives you some convenient functionality to manage an activity log.

## üì¶ Installation

### Install package using SPM

Update your `Package.swift` file:

#### Swift 3

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/nodes-vapor/admin-panel-provider.git", majorVersion: 0, minor: 4)
```
#### Swift 4

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/nodes-vapor/admin-panel-provider.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "0.4.0")),
```
```swift
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "App",
        dependencies: [
            ...
            "AdminPanelProvider"
        ]
    ),
    ...
]
```

Next time you run e.g. `vapor update` Admin Panel will be installed.

### Install resources

Copy the `Resources` and `Public` folders from this repo into your project. You can download the repo as a zip and then move the folders to the root of your project. Remember to check that you're not overwriting any files in your project.


## üöÄ Getting started

### Add provider

In your `Config+Setup.swift` (or wherever you setup your providers), make sure to add the Admin Panel provider:

```swift
import AdminPanelProvider

// ...

private func setupProviders() throws {
    // ...
    try addProvider(AdminPanelProvider.Provider.self)
}
```

Also make sure that you add the Fluent provider if it hasn't been already:

```swift
try addProvider(FluentProvider.Provider.self)
```

### Setup view renderer

This package relies heavily on the [Leaf](https://docs.vapor.codes/2.0/leaf/package/) view renderer. For Admin Panel to work, please make sure that you have added the `LeafProvider`:

```swift
import LeafProvider

// ...

private func setupProviders() throws {
    // ...
    try addProvider(LeafProvider.Provider.self)
}
```

Make sure your project is using Leaf as the view renderer. You can set leaf as your renderer by setting the key `view` to the value `leaf` in your `droplet.json`. In case it's not given yet, just add it:

```json
"//": "Choose which view renderer to use",
"//": "leaf: Vapor's Leaf renderer",
"view": "leaf",
```

### Seed a user

If you haven't added a SSO provider, the next thing you need to do is to seed a user in order to be able to login into your new admin panel. To do this, add the seeder command to your `commands` array in your `droplet.json`:

```json
"//": "Choose which commands this application can run",
"//": "prepare: Supplied by the Fluent provider. Prepares the database (configure in fluent.json)",
"commands": [
    "prepare",
    "admin-panel:seeder"
],
```
Now you have two ways of running the seeder. You either run the seeder in your terminal by:

```
vapor build; vapor run admin-panel:seeder
```

Or you temporarily edit the `Run` scheme in Xcode and add `admin-panel:seeder` under "Arguments Passed On Launch". This will run the seeder when you run the project. Run the project and remove the argument after the user has been seeded.

The user that will be created using the seeder will have the following credentials:

- Email: **admin@admin.com**
- Password: **admin**

### Vapor & Fuzzy Array
Vapor has a `Node.fuzzy` array that's used for dynamically casting at runtime. If you're experiencing inconsistencies with rendering templates it's most likely because your fuzzy array is missing `ViewData.self` Ensure that you have added it to the array or that all of your models conform to `JSON`/`Node`.
Example `Node.fuzzy`:
```swift
extension Config {
    public func setup() throws {
        // allow fuzzy conversions for these types
        // (add your own types here)
        Node.fuzzy = [JSON.self, Node.self, ViewData.self]
```

### Custom Leaf tags
Admin Panel comes with a bunch of custom Leaf tags that help ease the burden of frontend development. Check out the full list [here](https://github.com/nodes-vapor/admin-panel-provider/wiki/Leaf-Tags).

### CORS:
It's highly recommended that you add the [CORS middleware](https://docs.vapor.codes/2.0/http/cors/) to your project.

## üîß Configurations

Admin Panel can be configured by (adding or) modifying the `adminpanel.json` config file. Below is a breakdown of the available keys.
