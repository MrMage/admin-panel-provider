Admin Panel makes it easy to setup and maintain admin features for your Vapor project. Here's a list of some of the top feautures that comes out of the box with this package:

- **UI Components:** Admin Panel is built using [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/), a highly battle-tested and maintained Control Panel Template. This means that you'll have access to features from AdminLTE through [Leaf](https://docs.vapor.codes/2.0/leaf/leaf/#leaf) tags.
- **User System:** This package come with a (admin panel) user system with roles built-in. The package also handles welcome emails and reset-password flows.
- **SSO Support:** Built-in support for adding your own custom SSO provider.
- **Activities**: Need to broadcast certain updates to the admin panel users? No problem, Admin Panel gives you some convenient functionality to manage an activity log.

## üì¶ Installation

### Install package using SPM

Update your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/nodes-vapor/admin-panel-provider.git", majorVersion: 0)
```

Next time you run e.g. `vapor update` Admin Panel will be installed.

### Install resources

Move the `Resources`and `Public` folders from this repo into your project. Unfortunately there's no convenient to this at the moment, but one option is to download this repo as a zip and then move the folders into the root of your project. Remember to check that you're not overwriting any files in your project.


## üöÄ Getting started

### Add provider

In your `Config+Setup.swift` (or wherever you setup your providers), make sure to add the Admin Panel provider:

```swift
import AdminPanelProvider

// ...

private func setupProviders() throws {
    // ...
    try addProvider(AdminPanelProvider.Provider.self)
}
```

### Setup view renderer

This package relies heavily on the [Leaf](https://docs.vapor.codes/2.0/leaf/package/) view renderer. For Admin Panel to work, please make sure that you have added the `LeafProvider`:

```swift
try addProvider(LeafProvider.Provider.self)
```

After adding the provider, please make sure that your project is using Leaf as the view renderer. To do that, please ensure that the `view` key is set correctly in `droplet.json`:

```json
"//": "Choose which view renderer to use",
"//": "leaf: Vapor's Leaf renderer",
"view": "leaf"
```

### Seed a user

If you haven't added a SSO provider, the next thing you need to do is to seed a user in order to be able to login into your new admin panel. To do this, simply run the following command:

```
vapor build; vapor run admin-panel:seeder
```

The user that will be created using the seeder will have the following credentials:

- Email: **admin@admin.com**
- Password: **admin**

## üîß Configurations

Admin Panel can be configured by (adding or) modifying the `adminpanel.json` config file. Below is a breakdown of the available keys.

| Key       | Example value           | Required | Description                              |
| --------- | ----------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `name`    | `My Tech Blog`          | No       | This will be the title inside of the admin panel. |
| `baseUrl` | `http://mytechblog.com` | No       | This will be used to generate urls for the admin panel (e.g. when resetting a password). |
| `skin`    | `green-light`           | No       | The skin to use for the admin panel. The options will correspond to the [available skins](https://adminlte.io/themes/AdminLTE/documentation/index.html#layout) supported by AdminLTE. Please omit the `skin-` prefix when specifying the skin. |
